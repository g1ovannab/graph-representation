# Graph Implementation

## What is this?
This is a Graph Implementation for 'Algoritmos em Grafos' for PUC Minas. Here, we need to have a graph (we'll have 4 types of graphs: directed and weighted, directed and non-weighted, non-directed and weighted and finally, non-directed and non-weighted) 'translated' in text form so the code can understand.

We need to find the best implementation for each graph (matrix or list) and justify the choice.

## How the files will be organized
```txt
1	0/1				//directed	- 0 no; 1 yes
2	0/1				//weighted 	- 0 no; 1 yes
3	90 				//number of vertices
4	120				//number of edges
5	1 2 3 (...)     //vertices
6	1 2
7	2 3 290         //ATENTION! If there's more than 2 numbers in the edge line, it means that 
                    the third number is the wieghted one
8	3 4
9	5 6             //edges
10	6 7
11	FLAG			//flag
12
